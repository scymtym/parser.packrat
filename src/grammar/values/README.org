#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* Introduction

  Currently, there is no grammar but only an environment. This
  environment allows treating a static sequence of variables as a
  sequence input for matching or parsing.

  Since the sequence as aspect is completely static, no code or
  runtime state is needed to handle it. Therefore, the generated code
  just sequentially processes an ordered set of objects.

* Calling Convention

  src_lisp[:results output verbatim :exports results]{(print-calling-convention-lambda-list (make-instance 'parser.packrat.grammar.values::values-environment))} {{{results(=NIL=)}}}.

* Optimizations

  There are no specialized optimizations for this grammar.
