* Introduction

  This grammar is sequence-based and operates on ~simple-string~
  inputs.

* Calling Convention

  The usual calling convention for sequence-based grammars, that is
  =(string length position)=.

* Optimizations

  + The sequence type and element type are declared.

  + A new expression kind ~string-terminal~ is compiled to a string
    comparison. (Not sure this is a good optimization in the long run)
